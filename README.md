# new-Repository
This is my first project using #C_programming And the project in short it is #Bank_Data_Base when you run the program gives you 6 options to choose from:

1)Create a database for a new customer.

2)Delete a database of the client's specified IP address via his own.

3)You edit the database for a specific client via its own IP.

4)Transferring money from clients to another customer via the IP for each of them.

5)The database is printed with the client's specified name by entering his own IP.

6) Exit and database.

-The data of any customer is a structure consisting of his name, his IP, and the money that is in his account and his account type. Is he a debtor or a credit..!
