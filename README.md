# New Repository
This is my first project using **C programming** And the project in short it is **Bank Data Base** when you run the program gives you **6 options** to choose from:

* 1-Create a database for a new customer.

* 2- Delete a database of the client's specified IP address via his own.

* 3-You edit the database for a specific client via its own IP.

* 3-Transferring money from clients to another customer via the IP for each of them.

* 4-The database is printed with the client's specified name by entering his own IP.

* 5- Exit and database.

##The data of any customer is a structure consisting of his name, his IP, and the money that is in his account and his account type. Is he a debtor or a credit..!
